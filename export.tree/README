Notes
----------
Electroglottography (EGG) and audio are included in the EEG files themselves, rather than in sidecar files, as they were converted from analog to digital on the same hardware. The audio is the audio the subject heard, i.e. their delayed auditory feedback. If you want the speech waveform aligned to the time the subject produced it, you can shift the audio back by the timestamps recorded (for each trial) in the delay field of the events sidecar file. 

EGG has already been minimally preprocessed to correct for phase delays induced by the built-in hardware filter of the EGG amplifier by applying an equivalent software filter in the opposite temporal direction. (This is the same strategy employed by "zero phase shift" filters in MATLAB and scipy.)

Data was organized according the the BIDS standard for EEG data using the MNE-BIDS software (Appelhoff et al., 2019; Pernet et al., 2019).
